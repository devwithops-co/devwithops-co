# VCS Hosting:
- When working on a team, you often need a remote place to put your code so others can access it, create their own branches, and create or review pull requests. 
- These services often include issue tracking, code review, and continuous integration features. A few popular choices are GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket.
1. Bitbucket:
- A Git-based source code repository hosting service owned by Atlassian.
- Gives you a central place to manage git repositories, collaborate on your source code and guide you through the development flow. 
- Its interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git.
- It provides awesome features that include:
  - Code Review System
  - Powerful JIRA Integration
  - In-line Discussion
  - BitBucket Cloud & Server
- Advantages:
  - Easier to connect with other DevOps tools (like Jenkins, Jira)
  - Effective in managing code compliance and security requirements
  - Adaptable to a different OS.
1. GitLab:
- A web-based Git repository that provides free open and private repositories, issue-following capabilities, and wikis.
- It is a complete DevOps platform that enables professionals to perform all the tasks in a project—from project planning and source code management to monitoring and security.

1. GitHub:
- A provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git.
